        <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
        <p><i>Dog are great companions for any person </i>as they are loyal.
            Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand 
            the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures 
            of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So, 
            telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you
             feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, 
             and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are 
             the perfect example of this.</p>

            <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, 
                it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's 
                nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated 
                by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.</p>
